SauerFork


In order to give us the chance of getting to know you, would you, as part of the project “SauerFork”, like to introduce yourself in a few sentences?


How did the idea come up to create a “new” Sauerbraten?


We’ve already watched some of your videos and found they look really promising, especially the new particles and camera system. 
Do you want to tell us something about the core features of the game?


Many of us have played the game for several years and are used to the original Sauerbraten’s gameplay. 
Should we therefore be prepared for any major changes regarding gameplay in SauerFork? Additionally, will the game stay compatible to the existing contents?


All that’s been said sounds like a huge amount of work. What progress have you already made and whats the current stage of development compared to your aims?


If I recall correctly, some of you are also involved in other Sauerbraten projects. 
How do the experiences with these other projects help you on this project?
