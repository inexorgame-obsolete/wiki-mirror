## SauerFork

## [GO TO THE PAD HERE](https://piratenpad.de/p/Sauercominterview)


##Semi-final version:

### Sauercom: Welcome "Sauerfork", some of our readers might have already heard about your plans, others maybe not.  What are you working on? 

**supertux:** Generally said we are a bunch of developers working on a fork of Sauerbraten, which tries to stay as sauerlike as possible while adding new features and renewing everything which blocks future progress and creativity.      
If you actually asked which features we're working on, we could all throw in a single mysthic feature we're currently implementing:


**Hanack:** Particles!  
**a_teammate:** ingame content deployment!  
**sanitizer:** web presence!  
**superTUX:** weapon system!  
**Hanni:** visual scripting!  
**Fohlen:** client-community integration!  
**Fatality:** new gameworlds!  
**mapc:** CEF!  
**nothing:** Sound track!  
**Nooby:** Free content!  
**killme:** CMake!  
**PeterPenacka:** XMPP!  
  
**nothing:** Ok, i hope that was cryptical enough to let all your imagination run free!  

### Sauercom: How did this idea to create a "new" Sauerbraten come up?

**Peter Penacka:** Over time we've noticed that many developers created features in their own mods while on the other hand the game itself has been stagnating and even struggles with a slowly decreasing playerbase.  Most of these mods are very interesting: better editing, improved shaders, gui improvements, custom weapon models... even custom game modes. It's a pity that all these ideas didn't make it into the game. So we join our forces in order to bring this energy together. To keep Sauerbraten alive.


### Sauercom: What will be the difference between forking the game and simply making a mod?

**a_teammate:** Most of us have already gained experience in modding sauerbraten as well as the huge limitations you have.  If you for example want to detect whether a match is a clanwar or a public game, its pretty straight-forward done for a fork. Just a few lines of code. Modding the existing sauerbraten on the other hand would complicate things a lot and would require to implement dirty work-arounds in thousand lines of code.  
**Hanni:** Summarized you can say a fork allows to code cleanly and speed up the development. On the downside you can not connect to an old sauerbraten server with our next-gen client or vice-versa.  

### Sauercom: So can SauerFork be considered as the "official" successor of sauerbraten?

**Hanack:** Successor? Yes - Official? Probably not (yet?).

### Sauercom: A big issue for the community has always been to contribute to the development of Sauerbraten. How much will the community be integrated into this project?

**supertux:**           We want to make it as easy as possible to contribute and share new stuff, e.g. by making the game more customizeable.  
**a_teammate:**       Furthermore we see our work more as laying the base. If the base allows creativity, the main input will come from the community.  
**sanitizer:**     Our upcoming website is going to be the place connecting all the people contributing to sauerfork. From decisions about features (e.g. in polls or  suggestions) to a content showcase similar to quadropolis, it will allow people to participate in the developement.  
**Fohlen:** We want to be fully transparent. We plan to blog about progress in the development of new features on our website. Furthermore we develop publicly on github in separate branches, so new features can be tested by everyone. On the Github wiki we document the new ideas and the implementation of those.

### Saurcom: You are currently looking for a new name and people are encouraged to submit names. When and how will you decide about the new name?

**sanitizer:** Yet everyone can suggest names at http://sauername.tk/ , deadline is the 15th october. After that you'll be able to vote for the final name!  
**killme:** thou we probably have to shrink the list of names a bit which are open for the poll. Lets say 10-15 names. Still I hope for good name-suggestions which fit the game, or funny ones, crazy ones or just a stupid one. Go for it!  

### Sauercom: So how else can people contribute to the project already?

**Fohlen:** Join our IRC channel, create a github account and go for it. There's enough work in front of us for everyone!  
**Nooby:** In my opinion one of our main issues is that we want to make sauerbraten completely free. Little  explanation: Thou Sauerbratens source is, big parts of the content are not. So we have to recreate a lot of things which are not freely licensed.  
**Fatality:** On the other hand we have a fresh start, which means we can set quality standards which fit our time. E.g. a reworked maps with improved textures and details.   
**mapc:** We do not only need people who can create models, generally content creators and developers but of course also people who can do some blog stuff, test things and so on. So basicly everyone is welcome.  

### Sauercom: Do you want to tell us something about the core features of the game?

**nothing:** Actually its too early to really present something.  
**sanitizer:** I think (for now) the core feature is the developing structure. We are non-hiarchical, which means everyone can contribute. Of course every feature has to gain a majority to make it into the final release.  
**Hanni:** We know this sounds new but it actually works! Thou we always have to adapt and focus our energy, but we communicate a lot and have fixed meetings, where we discuss which way the game is going to go.  
**killme:** The good thing is that we all share a similar idea, that sauer should stay sauer, but the thing around should come to a new level.  


### Sauercom: Many of us have played the game for several years and are used to the original Sauerbratenâ€™s gameplay. Should we therefore be prepared for any major changes regarding gameplay in SauerFork?  

**Hanni:** Highly probably no. Even small changes can destroy the overall feeling. The gameplay in sauer is just fine in our opinion. Minimalistic and unrealistic on the one hand, but fun on the other one. Why should we change that?  
**a_teammate:** A phrase once thrown into our IRC-Channel was "Stays sauer, becomes better". I think thats really catching it. So no, there are no major gameplay changes planned.

### SauerCom: Ok so no "major" gameplay changes. However, there have been a lot of complaints about the weapon balance in Sauerbraten. Are you going to address these issues?

**mapc:** Although every gameplay change is pretty controversial, we are open for suggestions. And if the new setting is an improvement it has high chances to be accepted by the playerbase.  
**Hanack:** Still I think it's understandable that changes have to be tested carefully. We will provide some servers for testing purposes, thou we gonna need helpers for testing a good weapon-arrangement.  

### Sauercom: Will the game stay compatible to the existing contents?
		
**Fatality:** New features may not be compatible to old maps for example. But we plan an importer for easily making old content available. So yes, you can play your old sauerbraten map with sauerfork as well.
**Fohlen:** It will be possible to obtain all the old content from a backward package. Anyhow old content won't benefit from new features of course.
**Nooby:** Still we encourage the content creators to adapt their work to SauerFork and license it under one of the free content licenses.

### Sauercom: What progress have you already made and whats the current stage of development compared to your aims?
		
**Hanack:** There is no single goal but development is a continous process. Currently we setup the development enviroment, the website and are still recruting new team members.  The first features are implemented but it takes some more time to get a first release finished. Of course we  have a lot of ideas but it takes time to make them reality. But we are optimistic to get a first alpha release finished soon.

### SauerCom: When can we expect the first alpha release that we can try out?

**supertux:** A first alpha released is planned at the end of year.  
**nothing:** We furthermore plan to release in regular intervals, on a publicly announced date and with a thorough testing period. So stay tuned.
