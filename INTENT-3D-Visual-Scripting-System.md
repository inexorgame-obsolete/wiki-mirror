# Introduction

Welcome to Inexor Intent!  
Intent is the code name for Inexor's implementation of a 3D visual scripting engine.

# Motivation
As you should know Inexor forked off from [Cube2: Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org/). If you take a closer look at Sauer's community you will notice that people have figured out many ways to bring the [Cube Engine](http://cubeengine.com/) to it's limits. Since there is no scripting interface for Cube2's multiplayer it is neccesary to modify the server software to create new gamemodes. By combining modded servers with the available standard game modes people created all interesting stuff. Remember: **You can't modify the client's software with scripts in Cube2 in multiplayer!**

## Modified game modes in Cube2
The popular gamemode "racing" for example is build on top of _coop edit_ mode. In race mode the server will send the next map to everyone before the round starts. Then racing starts and you have to find your way through the map in order to find the goal. Another example is the "rugby" mode which is build on _capture the flag_. Teammates can pass the flag by shooting each other. Also fun is the "zombie" mode which is build on Sauer's _efficiency team_ mode. One player starts as zombie and has to infect others. Those who are infected change the effic team and hunt on.

## The limits of Cube2's modified gamemodes
It is not possible to change the client's behaviour in any way since this would require your players to download a modified version of Cube2. Although there have been many attempts to establish modified clients no one really was abled to push through. Since Inexor is not just a modification of Cube2: Sauerbraten but a new game it offers the perfect opportunity for the implementation of a both server- and client-sided visual scripting system.

## What more do you want?
The greatest thing about introducing a new technology to Inexor is that you often can't forsee all the great things people will come up with when they use new features. In Cube2 we've seen people create remarkable gameplay by making the most of the technology that was available. But the creative mind of those people is far greater than the boundaries of technology which sets limits to them.
