Embedded scripting languages deliver flexibility and infinite room for creativity in games. Scripts are used everywhere. Scripts could be used for any interactive content in Inexor maps. Unfortunately, the Sauerbraten code base does not come with any high end scripting language (such as Javascript, LUA, Python or PAWN). All we have is Cubescript. Cubescript was invented in a time in which writing your own language was cooler than trusting Embedded frameworks. Cubescript may has its advantages, but it is hard to understand and barely documented. The advantages of solutions that are used millions of times all over the globe are obvious. Embedding Javascript and linking everything with entities and maps e.g. would improve our situation, but there is more.
Examples for embedded scripting:
* Javascript in your browser
* Python in Blender
* LUA in CryENGINE3, Unreal Engine and Unity

## Important of visual scripting systems
The idea of writing code "visually" is pretty cool. You just sit in front of your nodes and connect some of them with lines and it creates logic.
