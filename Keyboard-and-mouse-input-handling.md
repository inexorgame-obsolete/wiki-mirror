The new user interface requires a redesign of the keyboard and mouse handling.

## Keyboard input Handling

### Handling of key press and key release events (Binds)

Binds are managed in the C++ code. The mouse buttons and the mouse wheel are handled as normal keys also.

#### Input layer bit mask

The bit mask describes for which layers are affected by the key bind. The bits can be combined which means a bind affects multiple layers. If a key is pressed, it is checked if the bind affects the current layer.

| Bit           | Input Layer   |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| Bit 0         | GameLayer     |
| Bit 1         | HudLayer      |
| Bit 2         | AppLayer      |
| Bit 3         | ChatLayer     |
| Bit 4         | G3DLayer      |

Though the HudLayer is a valid input layer, it doesn't receive any input (neither key nor mouse input).

##### The sub input layer bit mask for the GameLayer

The game layer has a sub bit mask.

| Bit           | Input Sub layer     |
|:------------- |:------------------- |
| Bit 0         | Playing             |
| Bit 1         | Spectating          |
| Bit 2         | Editing             |

#### Bind mask

It shouldn't be able to bind all keys on all layers. In order to prevent useless or conflicting key/bitmask bindings, we're using a bind mask like shown in the table below. The X indicates if a key can be bind with the given bit.

| Key           | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|:------------- |:-- |:-- |:-- |:-- |
| A-Z           | x  |    |    |    |
| a-z           | x  |    |    |    |
| 0-9           | x  |    |    |    |
| !"ยง$%&/()=?   | x  |    |    |    |
| ENTER         | x  |    |    |    |
| POS1,END      | x  |    |    |    |
| BACKSPACE,DEL | x  |    |    |    |
| MOUSEWHEEL1-2 | x  |    | x  | x  |
| MOUSE1-3      | x  |    | x  | x  |
| ESC           | x  |    | x  | x  |
| F1-F12        | x  |    | x  | x  |

### Handling of text input

If no bind (key+bitmask) has matched, the key input is handled as text input. Text input is forwarded to the target layer as shown in the table below:

| GameLayer | AppLayer | ChatLayer | Target        |
|:--------- |:-------- |:--------- |:------------- |
| active    | inactive | inactive  | Ignore        |
| *         | active   | inactive  | AppLayer      |
| *         | *        | active    | ChatLayer     |

## Mouse input handling

If no bind (key+bitmask) has matched, the key input is handled as text input. Text input is forwarded to the target layer as shown in the table below:

| Mouse input      | GameLayer | AppLayer | ChatLayer | Target        | Remarks                  |
|:---------------- |:--------- |:-------- |:--------- |:------------- |:------------------------ |
| Mouse X / Y      | active    | inactive | inactive  | GameLayer     | Rotates the player       |
| Mouse X / Y      | *         | active   | inactive  | AppLayer      | Move the mouse in the UI |
| Mouse X / Y      | *         | *        | active    | Ignore        | No mouse input in chat   |
| Mousewheel U / D | active    | inactive | inactive  | GameLayer     | Binds                    |
| Mousewheel U / D | *         | active   | inactive  | AppLayer      | Mouse wheel in the UI    |
| Mousewheel U / D | *         | *        | active    | ChatLayer     | Binds                    |
