# The Common Theme
Inexor will end up being kind of a sandbox, and in fact it is already. Users should be able to create own theme and distribute them among their friends.

However a game needs a bit of a common theme.  
The original Sauerbraten theme is similar to that of old-school FPS like DOOM and Quake. Fast heavy metal music, rusty metal textures.

The gameplay of Sauerbraten is unique nowadays. It is fast, like really fast.

We do not think a game should be realistic. The reality has stupid constrains, real creativity can begin where we can get over them.

In order to be unique another FPS in gray and black is not what we are aiming for.
But the opposite: it should be colorful and weird.

The game should force us to see things differently, to never be sure about stuff.


Therefore ideas exist (although not overly concrete) to create a main story in sitcom style. The different characters  (although being monsters in a weird alien world) could review in a support group their daily fights and problems. All of them having drug problems, of different kind though.
This could combine totally orthogonally designed maps and campaigns. Everything they say is virtual, they just say it, they can lie, they can exaggerate, they can remember stuff wrong.
Their drug problems could add a distracting element to their stories.


While this sound pretty concrete it is not really. But we try to follow the theme idea which comes up here:
* being surreal
* being colorful

Search with your favorite search engine for "underwater world" or "LSD" images and you will get tons of reference material.

### When being distractive, don't be counterintuitive

Although the theme should bring color into the game and maybe bend the users head sometimes, it should always be obvious what the player actually needs to do.
The theme should not make it hard to see the goal, it should make it hard to reach the goal.

## Sound design

Inexor's gameplay is fast. Really fast.
Sauerbraten's match was heavy metal music.

Inexor's main soundtrack will probably contain really progressive trance or psytrance.
