### Todo
- add images
- add real toolset links (.bat/.sh)
- add images + description of the flex UI

Inexor for end user's currently supports the following platforms:

- Windows 7 and newer
- Ubuntu 16.04 (always the latest stable LTS)

The installation process is tied to 2 different sections:
- installing the dependency
- [use Inexor Flex to install Inexor](#install-the-game-via-flex), start the game (...)

Depending on your platform the setup is a bit different, see below:

- [on Windows](#setup-inexor-on-windows)
- [on Ubuntu](#setup-inexor-on-linux)


# Setup Inexor on Windows
Inexor comes with Node.js as it's requirement. At this point we urge the user to install Node.js [manually](https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.10.3/node-v6.10.3-x86.msi) (just download and install the file).


# Setup Inexor on Ubuntu
In order to run Inexor, a few dependencies must be installed. Copy the code from below into a terminal, and it should work magically:
`apt-get install xy`


# Install the game via flex
