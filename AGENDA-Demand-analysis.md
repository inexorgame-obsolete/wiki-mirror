# Introduction
In this article we will work out which features Agenda will have, how it works and how it is going to be used.

There are no class diagrams in here because this is part of [[Agenda's architecture|AGENDA architecture]].

### How fast is Agenda?
Having tested our early proof of concept, we've seen that there should be no speed concerns at all. Even more complex setups should run on old machines with proper speed.

# Map Editor Integration

### Who can use Agenda?
Agenda will be integrated into Inexor's map editor. This means it can be used in coop edit mode.

# Multiplayer Scripting

### Can visual scripts be edited in multiplayer?
Yes. They will be editable in cooperative editing mode.

### Will it work in multiplayer?
