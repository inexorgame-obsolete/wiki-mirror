Players want to join a game with others.
There are two solutions in the wild to achieve that:

* match making
* a Serverbrowser

while the two only differ in the regard that match making selects the server for you automatically.
The Serverbrowser on the other hand is a user interface so people can choose their server on their own.

What you need for both is, though:
The list of all available servers.

The blueprint we implement is
