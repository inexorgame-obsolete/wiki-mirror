### Goal

The source code of sauerbraten is mainly uncommented at the moment, but we are about to change that. Every new populated code should be clearly understandable, not only for you. The goal is to be get a quick overview by just reading the comments.

Commenting is not a hard task, but an important one. Your future self and other developers will appreciate the minutes you spend commenting.

Furthermore a tool generates the documentation in HTML format which will be published on the website.

### Doxygen

> Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, but it also supports other popular programming languages such as C, Objective-C, C#, PHP, Java, Python, IDL (Corba, Microsoft, and UNO/OpenOffice flavors), Fortran, VHDL, Tcl, and to some extent D.

### Special comment blocks

> A special comment block is a C or C++ style comment block with some additional markings, so doxygen knows it is a piece of structured text that needs to end up in the generated documentation.
