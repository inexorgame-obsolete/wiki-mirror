This guide is for people in the following situation:

You're new to programming, and think "Hey, why not start coding on Sauerbraten-Fork? I mean, I can do something useful, and maybe learn something new!"
You don't know what Git is or how to use it, the same applies for CMake. You know how to use Visual Studio though.

This Guide will help you find out how to download the sources and start coding in Visual Studio.

## Getting the sources

Sauerbraten-Fork uses Git as Source Code Management system (SCM). To get the sources, you need to install Git on Windows. There are two options:

* Getting MSYSGit
* Getting Github for Windows

Both do have advantages and disadvantages, though the latter one has a GUI, which might be easier to use for you. If you know how to use the CMD, then you can also go for MSYSGit.

### You decided to go for the noob way (aka downloading GitHub for Windows)

> Beware: You need Windows Vista or better!

Please visit [the GitHub website](https://windows.github.com/) and press "Download" (that's that large green button in the middle that catches your attraction). After downloading, open the installer binary (aka double click the "GitHubSetup.exe" file) and follow the instructions. Please don't annoy the Sauerbraten-Fork team with Github for Windows issues, there's that [GitHub help page](https://windows.github.com/help.html) that helps you in most cases.
