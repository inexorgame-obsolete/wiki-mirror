## Free content / Packaging / Content delivery
- All content is free, in order to make the game free (this makes the game itself forkable) **(WIP)**
- Content can be delivered by servers / repositories

## Easy modability and mod delivery
- Maps, Textures, Mapmodels download
- Packaging / Dependency Management for Content **(WIP)**
- Gamemode download (scriptable)
- Weapon download / Weapon settings (again, refer to Counter Strike)

## Deliver Inexor on Steam, Gog and maybe more platforms
- Bigger audience / more PR? This is debatable (see Warsow)
- Stronger community integration (eg: Quake Live's homepage)

## Community functions
- Global decentralized authentication + protection
  - Like jabber: multiple servers (multiple domains)
  - Global stats
  - Decentralized (multiple) master servers

## Improved mapping functions
  * Flow chart system for scripted maps **(WIP)**
  * Cooperative lightmapping

## Security
  * Anti-DDoS
  * Load balancing
  * Security enhancements

## Misc
* Replace single-player campaign mode by multi-player campaign mode (playable by a single player too)
* Replace bots by drones (flying robots, quadcopter, ...)
  * Don't need to fake human behaviour
* Gameplay adjustments
  * Weapon Balance
