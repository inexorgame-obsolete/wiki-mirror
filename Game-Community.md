This page tries to describe how we can make ingame communication work with users and how they can interact with each other.

How players create and share content and invite others to work with them. This spans a lot more topics, as content creation and collaboration is a central topic for Inexor. Sauerbraten works in a somewhat peer-to-peer fashion, where maps are downloaded and shared ingame via edit mode. But content can also be exposed to the outer world, like Quadropolis does as a community hub.

We want users to get into the game as quickly as possible, but still allow for elaborate user involvement.
Users can establish their place with the community. Allowing for easily sharing their contents, arranging games (duels, clan-fights, etc) or getting in touch with other players.

> Inexor will end up being kind of a sandbox, and in fact it is already. Users should be able to create their own themes and distribute them among their friends.

It is important to recite this here, to discuss the implementation details. At which points in the game can the user interact with the community? And how?

It would be great to have a similar experience as Steam has with its workshop - where users can publish their own content, download others. This could work ingame as also as a website to see the content. This would allow us to offer something as [Quadropolis](http://quadropolis.us/) (which was the community hub of Sauerbraten) as our own service to our users.

## Account / Profile

Every user can start out without an account. If you want to share or even maybe protect your created content, you may need an account.

## Clans

## Notifications

## Personal Scoreboard

## Content Browser

A Quadropolis clone that can be browsed ingame or exposed to a website. With the difference, that ingame you can almost immediately start exploring the map - without any messy installation instructions and moving folders. Inexor Flex makes sharing media already possible. This mechanism can be used to download game content provided by other users.
