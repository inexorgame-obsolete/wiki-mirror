The main menu provides the means to navigate the core contents of the game.

* Splash screen
* Server browser
* Settings
* Profile/Account
* Community
* Own content (Recently created/worked on)

## Key indicators

Since this part of the game expresses the first impression, it is very important to come to an agreement how the UI should look and feel.

We want users to get into the game as quickly as possible, but still allow for elaborate user involvement.
Users can establish their place with the community. Allowing for easily sharing their contents, arranging games (duels, clan-fights, etc) or getting in touch with other players.

## Further planning

* [ ] Define what pages/menus we need
* [ ] Define main layout
* [ ] Onboarding experience (first time visiting)
