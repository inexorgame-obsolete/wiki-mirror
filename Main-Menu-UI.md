Main project page: https://github.com/inexorgame/inexor-core/wiki/User-Interfaces
The main menu provides the means to navigate the core contents of the game.

* Splash screen
* Server browser
* Settings
* Profile/Account
* Community
* Own content (Recently created/worked on)

## Further planning

* [ ] Define what pages/menus we need
* [ ] Define design (look and feel)
  * [ ] How components (buttons, switches, sliders) look like
  * [ ] How interaction with the menu works (mouse? keyboard?)
  * [ ] How menus blend from one into another (motion design)
  * [ ] Which layouts do we use?
* [ ] Guided onboarding experience (first time visiting)
  * [ ] Get started quickly with the way users interact with the game
  * [ ] Empty states with actionable navigation (no profile created - create one now)
* [ ] Define how users can interact with other users outside servers and outside the game
  * [ ] What pages do they have?
  * [ ] How do they interact with others if they have no account/profile?
  * [ ] In what parts of the game do they access these pages?
  * [ ] What are the workflows to publish/download/share?
* [ ] User Profile
  * [ ] How do they create their own profile? (What is the minimum information required for authentication)
    * [ ] What other services do we integrate with for single sign on? Google? Twitter? Github?
  * [ ] What information can they provide?

## Key indicators

### First impression

Since this part of the game is accountable the first impression, it is very important to come to an agreement how the UI should look, feel and behave.

### Involving users

We want users to get into the game as quickly as possible, but still allow for elaborate user involvement.
Users can establish their place with the community. Allowing for easily sharing their contents, arranging games (duels, clan-fights, etc) or getting in touch with other players.

> Inexor will end up being kind of a sandbox, and in fact it is already. Users should be able to create their own themes and distribute them among their friends.  
> From [[The-Main-Theme]]

It is important to recite this here, to discuss the implementation details. What points in the menu does the user have to interact with the community?

It would be great to have a similar experience as Steam has with its workshop - where users can publish their own content, download others. This could work ingame as also as a website to see the content. This would allow us to offer something as [Quadropolis](http://quadropolis.us/) (which was the community hub of Sauerbraten) as our own service to our users.

## Design

> In order to be unique, another FPS in gray and black is not what we are aiming for. But the opposite: it should be colorful and weird.  
> From [[The-Main-Theme]]

We need to find a mix of offering the colorful weird UI we are looking for, but still allow for easily navigating.
A good next step is to compare to other splash screens/main menus of other games that offer a similar experience.

### Examples

TBD
