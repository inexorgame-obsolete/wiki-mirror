## The Vision

The more elements of the game an Inexorian can create, the better!
However you also want to share them with others. If you created a cool gamemode, you and your friends should be able to try it immediately online.

## The Background

We already have a cool and fun gameplay inherited from Sauerbraten. It should sustain in the new dynamic system as well!

## The Connection

We want to make a dynamic system for game modes.  
*The catch is: you can not do that by just sharing scripts across all players on the server.* Or they could do harm, i.e. by scanning your porn-folders.  
You want to have the game mode in a form, which is *distributable* to others without making worries.

#### Better approach (?)

* [[Blueprint: Gamemodes with Visual Scripting]]

or
* other blueprints? Got an idea? Create a wiki-page!
