## Textures

Please use (webp)[https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/] to store images for inexor: It supports transparency (like png), animation (like gif) and has a better compression algorithm than jpeg.
We use [SDL_Image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) to decode images. Check their website for a full list of supported formats.

## Music / Sounds

Until (SDL_Mixer)[https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/] supports (Opus)[http://www.opus-codec.org/], (Ogg Vorbis)[http://www.vorbis.com] should be used to encode audio for inexor: Unlike mp3 it is a royalty free file format and it provides a better compression than mp3.
Check out the SDL_Mixer website for a full list of supported sound formats.
