# Introduction

> The goal is to implement *module_sound* in order to further refactor and modularize Inexor's code.

Until now Inexor is using Cube2's old sound system which uses SDL_Mixer. It has no class design and is not documented at all which makes maintaining it quite unpleasant. We will also implement new features for inexor's sound system.
This code is mostly separated from other code parts so the refactoring progress shouldn't be too complicated.

This task is divided into 4 steps:

## Step I - Understanding the old sound system
_See main article:_ [[Cube2's old sound system code]]

## Step II - Planing the new sound system
_See main article:_ [[Inexor's sound system (architecture)]]

## Step III - Learning OpenAL/ALMixer
TODO...

## Step IV - Implementation and documentation
TODO...
