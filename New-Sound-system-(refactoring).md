# Introduction
Until now Inexor is using the Cube2's old sound system. Sound code is mostly separated from other code parts and can be refactored easily. The goal is to implement *module_sound* as a replacement for sounds.cpp. **SDL_Mixer** will be replaced with either **ALMixer** or pure **OpenAL**.
