## Labels
Our GitHub issues are organized [with labels](https://github.com/inexorgame/code/labels). This makes them easily searchable and easier to overview.
Our labels have prefixes which are explained in the following:

Prefix | Meaning      | Example
------ | ---------    | ---------
cat    | category     | bug, enhancement, refactor
diff   | difficulty   | beginner, advanced
feat   | feature      | server, ui
org    | organization | planned, wontfix, duplicate
plat   | platform     | windows, linux, osx
prio   | priority     | build failing, critical

### Special Labels
Furthermore, we have the special label [**_good first bug_**](https://github.com/inexorgame/code/labels/good%20first%20bug) pointing to issues, which are very suitable for people new to Inexor. If you are also new to coding in general or our specific technologies, you can [search for a combination](https://github.com/inexorgame/code/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+bug%22+label%3Adiff%3Abeginner+is%3Aopen) between **_good first bug_** and **_diff:beginner_**.
