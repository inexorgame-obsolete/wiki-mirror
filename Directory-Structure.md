Notice: everything is **singular**, otherwise its pretty self-explaining. 
Directories, to which map designers normally often add files, have a ``directory/nickname/stuff`` structure to keep them clean.

## Differences to Sauerbratens structure

* scripts are in config/
* config.cfg is named saved.cfg
* **Paths are relative to their executing file**
  * makes independent (shareable) folders possible

## In the future:
* every content has its own configuration file
* TOMLs instead of .cfgs
* versions and more
