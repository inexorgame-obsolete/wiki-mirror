As mentioned in the [[introduction article|3D Visual Scripting]], a set of **nodes** and **relations** is called a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))

The **direction** of relations with nodes is very important!

For the implementation we are probably going to use the [boost graph library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_64_0/libs/graph/doc/index.html).
