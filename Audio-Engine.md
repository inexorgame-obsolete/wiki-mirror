# Introduction
As part of Inexor's overall refactoring strategy, it's audio engine will be redesigned and rewritten from the ground up build on [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/). Inexor currently still uses Cube2's old audio code.

# Goals
* Multithreading
* Asynchronous resource loading
* Class-based code design


# GPU-based 3D sound propagation algorithm ?
Realistic 3D graphics in realtime are quite developed these days.
3D sound propagation however is still not really in the focus of development. Sadly there is no open source library for this to this day. Time to change this!
